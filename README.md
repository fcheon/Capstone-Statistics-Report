# Capstone-Statistics-ReportGet going by asking the following questions and looking for the answers with some code and plots:

Can you count something interesting?

Can you find some trends (high, low, increase, decrease, anomalies)?

Can you make a bar plot or a histogram?

Can you compare two related quantities?

Can you make a scatterplot?

Can you make a time-series plot?

Having made these plots, what are some insights you get from them? Do you see any correlations? Is there a hypothesis you would like to investigate further? What other questions do they lead you to ask?
